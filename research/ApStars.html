<h4>On peculiar abundance of certain heavy elements in Ap stars </h4>

<p> In astronomy, stars are sometime classified by the spectral composition of their lights; 
see e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_A ">this</a> wikipedia 
article for a quick introduction. Among all the stars, the most common ones those can be seen with 
naked eyes are the A stars. The light from these stars is white or bluish-white. They 
have strong hydrogen lines and also lines of ionized metals. A certain class of stars are called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap_and_Bp_stars">Ap Stars</a>, which are "peculiar" A 
stars. They are peculiar because they show overabundance of certain elements, for example, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium">strontium</a>, 
<a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium">chromium</a> 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium">europium</a>.
These stars also have much slower rotation rate than normal A or B type stars. 
This project is an attempt to understand the peculiary (or overbundance) of these stars. 
</p>

<h5>Introduction </h5>
<p>
These stars typically have a hydrogen atmosphere with a shallow convective zone. 
Naively speaking, one would expect the heavy elements to sink in a hydrogen atmosphere, 
hence their characteristic lines would be absent from the spectra of the star. 
This conundrum is solved by realising that in addition to gravity, radiation pressure
acts on the heavy ions. This gives rise to an accelation of the heavy ions  
given by 
\begin{equation}
g_{\rm rad} = \frac{1}{mc}\int \sigma_{\nu}F_{\nu} d\nu
\end{equation}
Where $F_{\nu}d\nu$ is the net outward radiation flux in the frequency range $d\nu$, $\sigma_{\nu}$ is the
absorption cross-section for light with frequency $\nu$, $m$ is the mass of the ion and $c$ the speed of light;
see e.g., <a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1970ApJ...160..641M&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf ">Michaud, ApJ, 1970 </a>.
This acceleration can drive the ions up, depending on their mass and absorption cross-section. 
It is necessary to solve for detailed numerical models to calculate the abundance of the heavy elements
and the resulting spectral from models of stellar atmosphere. 
Such calculations (references ?) are generally succesful is reproducing the "peculiarity" of the Ap start. 
But such calculations ignore a particularly important effect, that of turbulence of the 
convection zone of these stars. To appreciate the role of turbulence, note that in our 
discussions above we have so far ignored the diffusion of the atoms. 
The effects of diffusion is not a large one because atmoic diffusion coefficients are typically small. 
But <a href="http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s2-20/1/196.full.pdf+html">turbulence gives rise to diffusion</a> 
and the turbulent diffusion coefficients are typically quite large. 
So how do we justify neglecting turbulent mixing (or turbulent diffusion) in this problem ? 
One way is to realise that the Ap stars also have a large magnetic fiel (in one case it 
has been found to be be as large as $42$KGauss ). Could this large magnetic field "quench"
turbulent diffusivisity ? We intend to perform numrical experiments to test this hypothesis. 
</p>
<h5> Numerical Experiments </h5>
<p>
Our domain is a periodic box of size $2\pi$ in each direction. 
We solve for the equations of isothermal magnetohydrodynamics, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_t (\rho U_i) + {\rm div}(\rho U_iU_j) &=& -{\rm grad}(p) + \nu\nabla^2 U_i + \frac{1}{\mu_0}({\bf J}\times{\bf B}) + {\bf f} \\
\partial_t \rho + {\rm div}({\bf U}\rho) &=& 0  \\
c^2_s &=& \gamma \frac{p}{\rho} = {\rm constant}\\
\partial_t {\bf B} &=& {\rm curl}({\bf U}\times{\bf B} -\eta {\bf J})  
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\bf J} = {\rm curl}({\bf B})$. Here instead of running a simulation of convection we simulate forced 
turbulence.  In addition we solve for the equation of a passive scalar, 
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \theta + {\rm div}({\bf U}\theta) = \kappa\nabla^2 \theta  
\end{equation}  
If there had been no turbulence the scalar would diffuse with a diffusion constant $\kappa$ which is typically
very small. In the presence of turbulence, we expect that the diffusion will be enhanced.
A specific way to quantify this enhancement appears laters. 
Next We impose a constant magnetic field, 
${\bf B} = \hat{z}B_0$. 
We expect that at high $B_0$ the turbulent transport of scalar along the vertical ($z$) direction will be 
suppressed. A quantitative way to measure this would be to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds-averaged_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations ">Reynolds average</a> the equation for the passive scalar
and write an effective equation. This equation would contain the effective turbulent diffusivity, $\kappa_{\rm t}$
in the following manner:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \Theta = (\kappa_{\rm t} + \kappa) \nabla^2 \Theta
\end{equation}
where $\Theta = {\bar \theta}$, and the symbol ${\bar \cdot}$ denotes Reynolds averaging. 
One way of Reynolds averaging is to average over the coordinate directions $x$ and $y$. If this
prescription of Reynolds averaging is used, the effective equation looks like:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \Theta = (\kappa_{\rm t} + \kappa) \partial_z^2 \Theta
\end{equation}
which, under Fourier transform in space takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t {\hat \Theta} = -\kappa_{\rm T} q^2 {\hat \Theta}
\end{equation}  
with $\kappa_{\rm T} = \kappa_{\rm t} + \kappa$
Hence, a way to measure $\kappa_{\rm T}$ is to calculate $\Theta(z) = \langle \theta(x,y,z) \rangle_{xy}$, 
transform it to Fourier space to construct ${\hat \Theta}(q,t)$ which in time is expected to show
\begin{equation}
{\hat\Theta}(q,t) = {\hat\Theta}(q,0)\exp[-\kappa_{\rm T}(q) q^2 t] 
\end{equation}  
Unfortunately the turbulent transport coefficient in contrast with the molecular transport coeffeicient, $\kappa$,
is not a constant but a function of the the wave number $q$. 
We intend to calculate $\kappa_{rm t}$ by the method explained above.  
In the presence of the external magnetic field we expect 
$\kappa_{\rm t}(q,B_0)$ 
to decrease as a function of 
$B_0$ particularly for larger $B_0$ we anticipate catastrophic quenching, which implies that 
\begin{equation} 
\kappa_{\rm t}(q,B_0) \sim \frac{\kappa_{\rm t}(q,0)}{B_0} 
\end{equation}

<h5> Computational Resources </h5>
<p>We shall use the pencil-code, which is a open-source MPI parallelized solver the partial differential equations (PDEs) that are relevant to fluid and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The code shows (weak) linear scaling up to 70, 000 cores. I am one of the core developers of this code. As part of other SNIC projects the code has been ported and ran in abisko.</p> 

<p>It would be necessary to run the code in 256^3 and 512^3 and 1024^3 resolutions in periodic boxes. 
Let us first estimate the resources necessary to run in $256^3$ grid points: 
Our tests in the computer beskow shows that for this case the code takes 
$6.421\times10^{-3}$ $\mu s$ per-grid point, per-time-step. Roughly speaking, we need to run the code
for about 10 large-eddy-turnover-times. One large-eddy-turnover-time is about $10$ unit of time in code-units. 
The time-step used in these simulations are $\delta t = 10^{-4}$ in code units. Hence one large-eddy-turnover-time
implies about $10^5$ iterations. And $10$ large-eddy-turnover-time simply $10^6$ iterations. Hence,
one such run requires 
\begin{eqnarray}
T &=& 6.421 \times 10^6 \times 256^3 \times 10^{-3} 10^{-6} s  \\
 &=& 29.924 Hr \approx 30 Hr  \\
 &=& 30 \times 256 core hours = 7680 core hours 
\end{eqnarray} 
We shall need to run one such run for one value of the magnetic field. It would be necessary to use at least $16$ 
different values of the magetic field. Which implies that we shall require $122880 \approx 130,000$ core hours. 
The memory requirement of one such run is $1.3$ GB. </p>
<p>
As the code has been demonstrated to show linear scaling we can continue this argument to estimate the time 
necessary to run for $512^3$ resolutions. In that case the minimum grid spacing will decrease by a factor of two
hence we expect the necessary time-step to decrease at least by a factor of two too. Then one large-eddy-turnover-time
requires $2\times10^5$ iterations. To reach the same time per-grid-point per-time-step we would need to use 
$256\times 8 = 2048$ number of processors. This may be too large a number. We would choose to use $512$ number of processors.
Hence we expect the time necessary to increase by a factor of $4$. Putting everything together, one run of $10$ 
large-eddy-turnover-times will require:
\begin{eqnarray}
T &=& 6.421 \times 10^6 \times 256^3 \times 10^{-3} 10^{-6} s  \times 2 \times 4\\
 &\approx& 240 Hr  \\
 &=& 30 \times 512 core hours = 122880 core hours 
\end{eqnarray}
Each of these runs will be run for $8$ different values of the magentic field, hence we shall require 
$983040\approx 1000,000$ core-hours. Each of these runs will require $11.4$ GB. 
</p> 

<p>In total, we shall need $1130,000$ core hours. Assuming some of the runs will be lost due to accidental 
mistakes we ask for $1400,000$ core hours. If we ask for the maximum amount allowed within a medium 
level application, which is $200, 000$ core hours, it would take us $7$ months to complete the work.
