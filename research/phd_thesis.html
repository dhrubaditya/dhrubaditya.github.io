<p>A little rabbit was sitting in a field,  scribbling on a pad of  paper,  
when a fox  came  along.  </p> 
"What  are   you  doing,  little  rabbit?"  </br>
"'I'm  working  on  my  dissertation,"  said the  rabbit. </br> 
"Really?" said the  fox.  "And what  is  your topic?" </br> 
""Oh,  the topic doesn't  matter," said the  rabbit. </br>
"No,  tell me , "  begged  the fox. </br> 
<p>"If you must know," said the rabbit,  "I'm advancing a theory that 
rabbits  can  eat  many  quite  large  animals - including,   for  instance, 
foxes. " 
<p>"Surely you  have no experimental  evidence for that, "  scoffed the 
fox. </p> 
<p>"Yes, I do," said the rabbit,  "and if you'd like  to step inside this 
cave for  a moment I'll  be glad to show you. "  So  the fox  followed  the 
rabbit into the cave. About half an hour passed. Then the rabbit came 
back out,  brushing a tuft of fox  fur off his chin,  and began once more 
to scribble  on  his pad of  paper. </p>
<p> News  spreads  quickly  in  the forest,  and  it  wasn't  long  before  a 
curious wolf came along.  "I hear you're writing a thesis, little rabbit.' 
said the  wolf. </p>   
"Yes , "  said the rabbit,  scribbling away.  </br>
"And  the  topic?" a sked the  wolf. </br> 
<p>"Not that it matters,  but I'm presenting some  evidence  that rabbits 
can  e a t   larger   animals - including,   for  example,  wolves."  The   wolf 
howled with  laughter.  " I  see  you  don't  believe me , "  said  the rabbit. 
"Perhaps  you  would  like  to  step  inside this  cave  and see  my  experimental  apparatus." 
Licking  her   chops,  the  wolf followed  the  rabbit  into  the  cave. 
About half  an hour passed before the rabbit came out of the cave with 
his pad of  paper ,  munching on what looked like  the end of a long gray 
tail. </p>
<p>Then along came a big brown bear.  "Wha t's  this I hear  about your 
thesis  topic?"  he demanded.  
''I  can't  imagine why  you  all keep pestering me about my  topic," 
said the rabbit irritably.  "As  if  the topic made any  difference at  all . "  
The   bear  sniggered  behind  his  paw.  "Something  about  rabbits 
eating  bigger  animals  was  what  I  heard- and  apparatus   inside  the 
cave. " </p> 
<p>"That's  r ight , "  snapped the rabbit, putting down his pencil.  "And 
if  you want to see  it I'll gladly show you. " Into the cave they went, and 
a half hour later the rabbit came out again picking his teeth with a big 
bear  claw.</p> 
<p>By now all the animals in the forest were getting nervous about the 
rabbit's project,  and a little mouse was elected to sneak up and peek 
into the cave when the rabbit's back was turned. There  she discovered 
that the mystery of the rabbit's thesis had not only a solution but  also 
a  moral.  The   mystery's  solution  is   that  the  cave  contained  an  
enormous  lion.  <b> And  the  moral  is  that   your  thesis  topic  really  doesn't 
matter - as  long  as  you  have the right  thesis  advisor.</b> </p>

<p>The physics of turbulence is the study of the chaotic and irregular behaviour
driven fluids. It is ubiquitous in cosmic, terrestrial and laboratory 
environments.  To describe how the properties of a simple incompressible fluid 
it is sufficient to know its velocity at all points in space and as a function
of time. The equation of motion for the velocity of such a fluid is the 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. In more complicated cases, for example 
if the temperature of the fluid also fluctuates in space and time, the 
Navier-Stokes equation must be supplemented by additional equations. 
Incompressible fluid turbulence is the study of solutions of the Navier-Stokes 
equation at very high Reynolds numbers, , the dimensionless control 
parameter for this problem. The chaotic nature of these solutions 
leads us to characterise them by their statistical properties.  For example, 
statistical properties of fluid turbulence are characterised often by structure
 functions of velocity. For intermediate range of length scales, that is the
<b>inertial range</b>, these structure functions show multiscaling. 
Most studies concentrate on equal-time structure functions which
describe the equal-time statisticsl properties of the turbulent fluid. 
Dynamic properties can be measured by more general time-dependent structure 
functions. A major challenge in the field of fluid turbulence is to understand 
the multiscaling properties of both the equal-time and time-dependent structure
 functions of velocity starting from the Navier-Stokes equation. In this 
thesis we use numerical and analytical techniques to study scaling and 
multiscaling of equal-time and time-dependent structure functions in turbulence
not only i fluids but also in advection of passive-scalars and passive vectors,
and in randomly forced Burgers equation.  The thesis is organised as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>In Chapter 1 we give an overview of the physics of homogeneous and
isotropic turbulence. We describe some of the progresses made in experimental,
theoretical and computational studies. We begin by summarising the 
scaling theory of structure functions, originally proposed by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov">A.N. Kolmogorov</a> in 1941. 
We further discuss recent experimental and
numerical evidence in favour of multiscaling. We give a short introduction
to the multifractal model. We also introduce turbulence in the passive-scalar
problem and in the Burgers equation. 
</li>
<li>In Chapter 2 we present our new results on dynamic multiscaling in
fluid turbulence. We show that different ways of extracting time scales from 
time-dependent velocity structure functions lead to different 
dynamic-multiscaling exponents in fluid turbulence. These exponents are related
 to equal-time multiscaling exponents by different classes of bridge relations 
which we derive. We check this explicitly by detailed numerical simulations of
the GOY shell model for fluid turbulence. 
</li>
<li>In Chapter 3 we study dynamic multiscaling for passive-scalar and
passive-vector turbulence. An example of a passive-scalar field is 
the temperature field in the fluid, if the gradients of temperature are
small, such that the effects of convection in the system are neglibible. 
By using analytical methods, we find simple dynamic scaling for the Kraichnan 
model for passive scalar advection and also for a Kraichnan-type shell model 
for passive-scalar turbulence. Although the passive-scalar field in the
Kraichnan case is known to show equal-time multiscaling for structure
functions, we find simple dynamic scaling of the time-dependent structure
function. These results are further supported by our numerical simulations
on the shell models.  In the Kraichnan model the advecting velocity is a 
random Gaussian variable which is white-in-time.  We also consider a 
passive-scalar shell model advected by velocity from the GOY shell model of 
fluid turbulence. In this case the advecting velocity field is not Gaussian 
but has multifractal properties and we find dynamic multiscaling for the 
time-dependent passive-scalar structure functions. We discuss the 
implication of our study for passive-vector turbulence. We also touch upon the 
issues of the kinematic dynamo in the context of passive-vector shell models. 
</li>
<li>In Chapter 4 we present preliminary results from our study of dynamic
multiscaling for time-dependent velocity structure functions obtained from 
the Navier-Stokes equation. We present the first numerical algorithm for a 
pseudo-spectral, direct numerical simulation that yields quasi-Lagrangian
velocity. We calculate the equal-time, quasi-Lagrangian velocity structure
functions from (512 cubed and 256 cubed)  two-third dealiased pseudo-spectral 
simulations. We also present preliminary data for time-dependent Eulerian 
and quasi-Lagrangian structure functions. 
</li>
<li>In Chapter 5 we study turbulence in the one-dimensional 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers'_equation">Burgers equation</a>
with a white-in-time, Gaussian random force that has a Fourier-space spectrum 
of one over wave number. From very-high-resolution numerical 
simulations, in the limit of vanishing viscosity, we provide strong evidence 
for multiscaling of velocity structure functions, as opposed to bifractal 
scaling suggested by earlier, low-resolution studies. We discuss possible 
artifacts that can make bifractal scaling appear like genuine multiscaling and 
show that they are not present in our work. We discuss the implications of our 
study for multiscaling in fluid turbulence.
