<h3>Understanding erosion by flows </h3>
  <p> Erosion by flows is a commonly seen natural phenomenon.
  This happens on many different length scales. At large length scales
  one sees the effects of erosion by rivers. This is an intriguing
  geological phenomenon. The landscape is eroded by the river, which
  in turn can change the path of the river itself. This
  interconnectedness between boundaries and the flow is an essential
  aspect of erosion. </p>
  
<p> The problem manifests itself at different scales. If you consider
  river banks or even coastlines, you find that they are not simple
  shapes. A coastline typically has multifractal shape. That is the
  reason why measuring coastlines (or borders between countries) is
  nontrivial, see, e.g.,
  <a> <href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">
  the article in Wikipedia on coastline paradox
  and the references therein</a>. This was first pointed out by
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson">L.F. Richardson</a> and was later popularized by
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot">B.B. Mandelbrot</a> in his
  famous article
  <a href="http://users.math.yale.edu/~bbm3/web_pdfs/howLongIsTheCoastOfBritain.pdf">"How
  long is the coast of Britain?"</a>. So at certain length scales the
  surface which develops as a result of erosion can be quite
  complex. But you look at pebbles in a beach they have quite a smooth
  surface although they have have quite sharp angles. </p>

  <p> When faced with such complex problems, physicists start by
  looking for
  <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/">
  "simple but not simpler approach"</a>.  Consider a clay ball dipped
  in a flow and watch how it erodes. Exactly
  <a href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/shelley/papers/RMCSZ2012.pdf">this
  experiment</a> was performed by a group of applied mathematicians at
  the Courant Institute in New York. The first thing they notice is
  that the boundary of the clay ball changes very slowly compared to
  the flow velocities, as is observed in geological problems. This
separation of time-scales will play a crucial role in our treatment
of this problem. A summary of their results is: </p>
<ol>
  <li> The rate of erosion is proportional to the local wall-stress.
  <li> After a short time, the shape of the eroded body becomes
  self-similar.
  <li> Sharp corners can develop, particularly at stagnation points of
  the flow. 
</ol>

<p> Taking this experiment as our inspiration, we would like to start
with a numerical experiment. Consider a two dimensional flow
problem. A circle (a cylinder in three dimensions) in a cross-flow
as shown in the figure below: <p>
 <div id="myphoto" >
       <img src="./erosion_sketch.png" />
  </div>
<p> We expect that due to the wall-stress on the boundary material in
the circle are going to erode away. This erosion will change the
boundary of the solid object, the circle will possibly not remain a
circle. Hence we need a computational method that can deal with
boundaries that are not regular shape. In addition, we need to deal
with a dynamical boundary, but we are going to simplify the problem by
virtue of the separation of the time scales; as I suggest below: </p> 

<p> Let us use a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann code (LBM) to solve
this problem. Let us parametrise the boundary by a arc-length
variable $s$. So the closed boundary implies that $s$ is periodic.
We assume that the rate of erosion from the surface is proportional to
the wall-stress, so the mass loss over a time $\tau$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta M(s,\tau) \equiv \int_0^{\tau} \sigma_{\rm wall}(s,t) dt
\end{equation}
We need to assume $\tau$ to be neither to small or too large. Then we
run the code for time $\tau$ and calculate the mass-loss. We use this
mass-loss to deduce a new boundary. Then run the simulations again
with this new boundary. How does various shapes erode under this
method ? I expect that the shape is going to be more like a peeble
(smooth with sharp corners) than a multifractal surface. </p>

<p> In addition to erosion, we can also use to same idea to deal with 
deposition. For example, we could introduce heavy inertial particles in the problem. 
Some of these particles would hit the cylinder and depending on the coefficient of 
resitution between the cylinder and the particles they can stick. We can again wait for
time $\tau$ and calculate $\Delta M(s,\tau)$ with contributions from both deposition and 
erosion. </p>

<p> The problem is also interesting from astrophysical point of view. The central 
object could be a kilometer-sized planetesimal in a protoplanetary disk. 
Would the erosion favours certain shapes and also selects 
sizes larger than certain sizes (e.g., smaller objects are eroded away) ?  </p>

<p> The problem could then continued to 3 dimensions. The possibilities are endless. </p> 

<p> Collaborations: The problem has been designed by myself (Dhrubaditya Mitra, NORDITA) and 
Anders Johansen from the Lund Observatory.
