<p> The subject of my research is theoretical physics/applied mathematics and I like to 
interpret is as broadly as possible. A very brief introduction to my research is
below. </p>

<p>Natural systems are nonlinear, out of equilibrium, and span
multiple spatial and temporal scales.
Such complex systems arise in diverse contexts -- from biophysics and
neuroscience to turbulence and multiphase flows.
Frequently the governing equations at small scales are known
(e.g., Navier-Stokes, Hodgkin-Huxley), 
The challenge lies in deducing the emergent behavior at large scales.
This difficulty stems from three sources.
First, the underlying equations are nonlinear and rarely solvable
analytically.
Second, collective behavior often yields emergent phenomena not evident at
smaller scales (e.g., consciousness from neural interactions).
Third, these systems typically operate far from equilibrium, exhibiting
large, non-Gaussian fluctuations.
My research spans analytical methods (asymptotics, stochastic calculus,
multifractals) and  numerical techniques (spectral, finite difference,
Monte Carlo, machine learning) for such nonlinear multiscale problems.
I am also a core developer of the
<a href="https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/">Pencil Code</a>,
widely used in astrophysics. </p>

<p>I move into new areas of applications every seven-eight years. 
Over the last five years, I have worked on problems in
astrophysics, geophysics, fluid/solid mechanics, active matter, and biophysics.
Examples have appeared in

tools and analytical techniques for four interconnected applications:
Nanoscale Biology, Neuroscience, Turbulence and Geophysical
and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD).</p>
