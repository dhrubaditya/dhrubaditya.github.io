<b> Collision, fragmentation, coagulation in a turbulent environment: </b>
  <p> As an example, let us start with a model for formation of raindrops. The process of
    rain starts with moisture condensing on very small particles of dust which goes
    by the name cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The very small droplets of water thus
    formed grows further by condensation of moisture on their surfaces. If these 
    drops could grow only by condensation, then raindrops would form agonisingly slow. 
    How could they grow faster ? One possible way could be if the small droplets could
    collide and consequently merge to form bigger dropelts. This possibility was 
    addressed by  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Saffman">Saffman</a> and Turner,
    (<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=364367&fileId=S0022112056000020"> Journal of Fluid Mechanics, <b> 1 </b>, page 16, 1956</a>).
    They noted that two small droplets fall with the same terminal speed in a quiesent enviroment,
    hence their relative velocities are close to zero. Consequently, the only way two droplets
    can collide is if atmospheric turbulent flows make them collide.
    In turbulent flows, the difference of velocity between two points
    \begin{equation}
     \delta u(\ell) \sim \ell
    \end{equation}
    for very small $\ell$ (this essentially assumes that the velocity at small scales
    is Taylor-expandable). Hence, if the small water droplets move with the same velocity
    as the local fluid then they would not collide either, because as they come close and
    close together their relative velocities goes to zero. Of course, droplets do not
    move with the local fluid velocity. Because of the drag of the fluid on them, the simplest
    equation describing the motion of droplets is given by
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \dot{{\bf x}} &=& {\bf v}  \\
    \dot{{\bf v}} &=& \frac{1}{\tau}[{\bf u} - {\bf v}]  \\
    \end{eqnarray}
                                                                                 Here $\tau = 6\pi\mu a/m$, with $a$ the radius and $m$ the mass of a spherical particle, and
                                                                                   ${\bf u}$ is the fluid velocity at the location of the particle. Water droplets of a range
                                                                                    sizes satisfy these equations of motion to a good approximation. They are called heavy inertial
                                                                                      particles. In a recent breakthrough (independnetly by three different groups of scientists),
                                                                                        it has been argued that the relative velocities between such inertial particles can be
                                                                                          independent of their separation, at small separation. The turbulent flow determines the
                                                                                            relative velocities of collisions between the particles. This is a problem in fluid
                                                                                              mechanics. But once they collide are they going to merge or break up into even smaller
                                                                                                droplets ? This is a problem of material science. We aim to bring this two field together.
