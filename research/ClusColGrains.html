  <b> Clustering and Collision of grains in flows: </b>
  <p> In the last decade a significant advance has been made in
  understanding the behaviour of small heavy particles advected by
  turbulent flows. There are two principal motivations to study such
  problem. One is to understand rain formation and the second is to
  understand the formation of planets in a circumstellar disk. In both
  of these cases the crucial question is whether small objects can
  collide (frequently enough, in the right range of relative speeds)
  to eventually merge and form bigger objects -- raindrop in one case
  and planetesimals in the other. </p>

  <p> Most of the work has concentrated on study of small spherical objects. The
  behaviour of non-spherical but still small heavy objects can
  potentialy be quite different from spherical ones. Note further that
  although raindrops are to a good approximation spherical, the
  astrophysical dust is not. Our aim in this project is to study
  clustering and possible collisions between non-spherical
  objects. <p>

  <p> The simplest model of a non-spherical object would be an
  ellipsoid. Let us start by considering an ellipsoid with three
  principal axis. In what follows, we shall call an ellipsoid "a
  grain".  We shall start by making the following
  approximations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> The grains are passive objects, they do not modify the
    flow.
    <li> The grains are small and heavy such that the drag on them
    due to the flow, which would generate both a drag force and a drag
    torque (which is absent for spherical particles) can be obtained by
    solving the Stokes equation.
    <li> We ignore mutual interaction between two grains. This is
  a reasonable approximation for a low number density of grains. 
    <li> The flow is not obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes
  equation but is a time-independent solution of the Euler equation
  which has chaotic behaviour, in particular, the ABC
  (Arnold-Beltrami-Childress) flow. 
   </ul>
  <p> We would then have to solve the following numerical problem. The
  instantaneous velocity and angular velocity of a grain and the
  local velocity and its gradients (strain and vorticity) sets the
  drag for and drag torque. These are given the by the Jeffery's
  equation. With the force and torque thus determined, we need to
  solve the equation of motion of a rigid body. This last step is best
  done by using the quaternions to describe the rigid body
  rotations. </p>
   <p> The aim of the project is to calculate the following quantities:
   <ul>
      <li> How do the grains cluster ? This can be quantified by
     calculating the radial distribution function of their center of
  mass. 
     <li> Are the orientations of the grains correlated ?
     <li> More generally, we can calculate the joint probability
  density function of their relative position, relative angles and
  relative velocities. From this we can calculate the average number
  of collisions per-unit-time, per-unit-volume (in a large volume) of
  between two grains. 
   </ul>
   </p>
   
  <p>We have a code that solves this problem. The time-stepping is
  done by a Runge-Kutta fourth order method. The code is written in
   C++ . As each grain is independent of every other grain this
  problem is ripe for extreeme parallelisation. We have now
  written a CUDA code to solve the problem in GPU. We have already
  tested the code in GPU machines. We expect that the problem would
  require averaging over very large number of snapshots. We also need
  to scan a large range of parameters in terms of (a) the shape of the
  grains (b) their stokes number which is a ratio of the stopping time
  of a grain to characteristic time scale of flow.  </p>
