<h5> Basics of Teaching </h5>
Far  too  many  people  give  lectures  like  G- strings - they touch  on 
everything but  don't  really  cover a  thing. Let your lectures
instead resemble  tennis shorts.  Stick close  to the subject  and
cover as much as you can, but not so  much  that  the 
audience loses interest.

<p> A list of courses that I have teach now and had taught before. 
  Some of them have incomplete lecture notes. A word of warning though, the notes
  are work in progress, may contain mistakes.

     <h4> Soft Matter and Fluid Physics </h4>
     <p> 
     This is an graduate course for at the Physics Department of Stockholm University 
     which I now teach in the fall semester. 
     The course has its <a href="SoftMatter/index.html">own dedicated webpage</a>. 
     </p>
  </div>
  <div class="eachitem">
     <h4> Fluid Mechanics </h4>
     <p> 
     This is an undergraduate course for students in  Stockholm University 
     which I jointly taught from 2018 to 2022. 
     The course was hosted by both the Physics Department and
     the Meterology Department. I taught the fundamentals in the first
     half and my colleague Jonas Nycander taught the second part which
     was on geophysical flows. 
     The course has its <a href="FluidMech/index.html">own dedicated webpage</a>.

     <h4> Astrophysical Magnetohydrodynamics </h4>
     <p> 
     This is a graduate course for students in Astronomy Department of 
     Stockholm University that I taught from 2016 to 2022. 
     The course has its <a href="MHD/index.html">own dedicated webpage</a>.

  <div class="eachitem">
  <h4> Undergraduate course on Electrodynamics </h4>
   <p> 
   I taught this course as a part of the program Stockholm University offers to 
     students who are training as science teachers in gymnasiums (For 
     the ignorant, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)">gymnasium</a> 
     in this sense is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym ">gym</a>. ).
     I taught all the course except circuit theory. Which were covered by my colleague
     Lars Mattson. The course material is <a href="ElecDyn15/index.html">here</a>.

  <div class="eachitem">
  <h4> One lecture on soutions of MHD </h4>
    <p>
       I had the wonderful opportunity to teach for one hour in a one day crash course on 
       the 
       <a href="http://www.iucaa.in/~dipankar/MagneticUniverse/home.html">Magentic Universe</a>
       organized as a part of 
       <a href="http://astron-soc.in/conference/">the ASI meeting in 2015</a>.
       The meeting was organized by 
       Kandaswamy Subramanian and 
       Dipankar Bhattacharya. Here are my <a href="PuneMHD/notes.pdf">very short lecture notes</a>.

  <h4> Scientic computing using fortran </h4>
   <p> 
     A five week long course give as a graduate course in astronomy department of Stockholm 
     University.  The emphasis in this course in on <i> scientific computing </i> not 
    fortran. Although you may even be able to learn neat tricks in fortran from the course 
    material. </p> 
    <p> I have taught this course twice. Unfortunately, I do not have complete 
     lecture notes from either times. The first time I taught this I had all the
     hand-written lecture notes scanned but due to a crash of the nordita server in Dec. 
     2010 I lost most of it. Whatever could be salvaged is the following: </p> 
    <ul>
    <li> Latexed lecture notes as <a href="SciComp/notes.pdf">pdf file</a>. 
         Be warned that some of the links in this file might not work. 
    <li> <a href="SciComp/lecture3.pdf"> Lecture 3 </a> (handwritten and scanned)
    <li> <a href="SciComp/lecture4.pdf"> Lecture 4 </a> (handwritten and scanned)
    </ul>
    <p> The second time I taught the course I was less careful. So I do not have much
        material saved from that time. But whatever I had is available
       <a href="SciComp13/index.html">here</a>. Maybe I shall get a chance to teach this
        course again in future and then I shall be more careful in keep records.

  <h4> Short course on statistical theories of turbulence </h4>
    <p>Handwritten and scanned lecture notes delivered at SERC school in Kolkata December 2006. There
    were introductions to three different trends of present (at 2006) day turbulence research. These
    are not "stand-alone" lectures. Accompanying lectures were deliverd by Rahul Pandit and M.K. Verma. 
    The pdf file of the scanned notes are <a href="./kolkata06-scanned-notes.pdf">here</a>. 
    There notes were strongly influenced by lectures deliverd by K. Gawedzki in Warwick where
    I was a student.  If you are a beginner in turbulence research I strongly recommend the set of
    <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/se/knowledge/isbn/item1164939/">original lectures</a> to you.  </p>
