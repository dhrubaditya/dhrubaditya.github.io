calculation of functions -- roots of transcendental equations -- subroutines -- organizing your code
-- makefile -- interfacing C and fortran -- linking to existing libraries -- GSL -- how to write your own libraries 
</div>
<h4>Roots of polynomials </h4> 
<ol>
  <li> Newton's method -- Evaluation of polynomials and their
  derivatives in an efficient manner (synthetic division) -- convergence of Newton's method - write a code
  to implement binary chop and Newton's method for polynomials, Acton chapter 7 
</ol>

<h4>Subroutines </h4> 
<p>
Importance of organizing your code -- subroutines and functions -- calculation of factorial in a subroutine
-- recursive subroutines -- writing the factorial evaluation as a recursive subroutine --
point out that there is very little difference in
efficiency as far as using recursive subroutines are concerned -- putting subroutines in separate
files -- compiling and linking them together -- use of makefile 
</p>

<h4>Evaluating functions </h4>

Before we find roots of transcendental functions we need to plot the functions.
This itself can be a formidable task. Let us look at few examples.

<ol>
  <li> Evaluate $1-k^2$ for $k=0.99876$
  <li> Sum the series $g(\theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{8} b_k \cos(k\theta)$ [Acton page 11].
        Count the number of operations you need and show that it is more efficient to evaluate by
        formula for multiple angles, also discuss the additional trick. 
  <li> Evaluation of $e^{-x}$ by a power series summation. The series is absolutely and uniformly
       convergent. But using it in a computer is a disaster. Rather use the series of $e^x$ and
       invert the number you get. [Acton page 14]
  <li> Use of recurrence relations and loss of error in them. Consider the example of
      \begin{equation}
           J_{n-1}(x) + J_{n+1}(x) = \frac{2n}{x} J_n(x)
      \end{equation}
      Start with the following values for $J_0$ and $J_1$ from tables or mathematica for example.
      \begin{eqnarray}
       J_0(1) = 0.765198 \\
       J_1(1) = 0.440051
      \end{eqnarray}
      and proceed to show how much you loose precision. Rather run this iteration backward.
      But an even better method is to use $kJ_n$ where $k$ is a normalizing factor. [Acton page 23-24]
      This shows that most of the computation except the last normalizing step ocurrs by
      integer arithmatic. 
</ol>

So the basic message is that in general it is better to use specialized libraries to get evaluation of
function than to write your own code. But you must be aware of what those libraries must contain.
One of the most important libraries in this regard is the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

<h5> Using GSL </h5>
Let us begin with the GNU Scientific Library. This is a library
that allows you to get values for many functions of mathematical
physics. We have shown in earlier lectures how non-trivial it is
to accurately calculate these mathematical functions. The GSL
is hence of great potential use for us. But unfortunately it
is in C. Let us try to see how we could use that. 

As a first step download ${\tt gsl}$. Read its manual. 
This of course takes some time ! For the very impatient,
this is what you should do (But please do read the manual)
<div class="code">
<pre><code>
 ./configure --prefix= DIRNAME
  make
  make install
</code></pre>
</div>
This installs the library in the directory given by ${\tt DIRNAME}$. 
Now let us try to first write a C code that uses this library. 
Let us say we are trying to calculate Bessel function typically
denoted by $J_{\ell}(x)$ for a particular value of $\ell=0$ and $x=2.$. 
<div class="code">
  <pre><code>
#include <'stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>
/* compile with gcc test_gsl.c 
-lgsl -lgslcblas -L<DIRNAME>/lib -I<DIRNAME>/include */ 
     int main (void)
     {
       double x = 2.0;
       double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);
       printf ("J0(%g) = %.18e\n", x, y);
       return 0;
     }
</code></pre>
  </div>
I am not going to explain the C syntax above. But most
of it is obvious. Note that we need to include the header files
in the second line.  This code need to be compiled with the following
command 
<div class="code">
  <pre><code>
gcc test_gsl.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -L<DIRNAME>/lib -I<DIRNAME>/include
</code></pre>
</div>

The ${\tt -L}$ tells the compiler where to find the library. 
The ${\tt -I}$ tells the compiler where to find the hearder files
it wants to include. In a very crude representation this library
is a collection of object files. So your command compilers the
code you wrote and then links it with this already compiled subroutine. 
Now let us try to see how we could do this from fortran. In fortran
the function call in C above should be made into a subroutine. 
What is done is to first write a piece of C code which
interfaces between the fortran code and the C library. 
Such code are typically called ``wrapper''. Here is an example
<div class="code">
 <pre><code>
/* c2f_gsl_sf_bessel_Jl.c */
/*------------------------------------------*/
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

void wrapper_sf_jl_(double* y, int*l, double* x){
   *y = gsl_sf_bessel_jl(*l,*x);
}
</code></pre>
</div>


This calles the C function called ${\tt gsl\_sf\_bessel\_jl}$ which
already exists in the library. This piece of code also make
available a subroutine called ${\tt wrapper\_sf\_jl\_}$  to be
called from fortran. The fortran code that uses this looks
like
<div class="code">
 <pre><code>
program test_gsl
      integer, parameter :: N = 20
      double precision :: x, y,deltax
      integer :: l,i,j
      l = 2
      deltax = 1.0d0/dfloat(N)
      do i=1,N
        x = 0.0d0 + (i-1)*deltax 
        call wrapper_sf_jl(y,l,x) 
        write(*,*) x,y
      enddo
end program test_gsl
</code></pre>
</div>


To use them all together you need to give the following command
<div class="code">
  <pre><code>
gcc -c c2f_gsl_sf_bessel_Jl.c -lgsl 
    -lgslcblas -L<DIRNAME>/lib -I<DIRNAME>/include
</code></pre>
</div>
This creates an object file called ${\tt c2f\_gsl\_sf\_bessel\_Jl.o}$. 
Next compile your fortran code
<div class="code">
<pre><code>
gfortran -c test_gsl.f90
</code></pre>
</div>
Next they are to be linked
<div class="code">
<pre><code>
gfortran test_gsl.o c2f_gsl_sf_bessel_Jl.o -lgsl 
    -lgslcblas -L<DIRNAME>/lib
</code></pre>
</div>
This creates the file ${\tt a.out}$ whose output look like:
<div class="code">

Obviously the process can be easily automatised by using a {\tt Makefile}. 
I shall leave that for you to do. 

Note finally that there can be further improvements to this piece of
code. To make it run for any fortran compiler we need to take into
account the fact that some compiler put one underscore, some put two
and some none. This can be taken care in the following, possibly not
unique, way (This piece of code is taken out of the pencil-code )
<div class="code">
  <pre><code>
/* Wrapper C functions for the gsl library */
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_legendre.h>
#include <math.h>

#include "headers_c.h"

void FTNIZE(sp_besselj_l)
     (REAL* y, FINT*l, REAL* x) {
   *y =  gsl_sf_bessel_jl(*l,*x);
}
/* ------------------------------------------ */
void FTNIZE(sp_bessely_l)
     (REAL *y, FINT*l, REAL* x) {
   *y =  gsl_sf_bessel_yl(*l,*x);
}
/* ------------------------------------------ */
void FTNIZE(sp_harm_real)
     (REAL *y, FINT *l, FINT *m, REAL *theta, REAL *phi) {
  REAL Plm;
  FINT ell = *l;
  FINT emm = *m;
  REAL fi = *phi;
  REAL x =  cos(*theta);
  if(emm<0){
    Plm = gsl_sf_legendre_sphPlm(ell,-emm,x);
    *y = pow(-1,emm)*Plm*cos(emm*fi);}
  else{
    Plm = gsl_sf_legendre_sphPlm(ell,emm,x);
    *y = (REAL)pow(-1,emm)*Plm*cos(emm*fi);}
}
/* -------------------------------------------- */
void FTNIZE(sp_harm_imag)
     (REAL *y, FINT *l, FINT *m, REAL *theta, REAL *phi) {
  REAL Plm;
  FINT ell = *l;
  FINT emm = *m;
  REAL fi = *phi;
  REAL x =  cos(*theta);
  if(emm<0){
    Plm = gsl_sf_legendre_sphPlm(ell,-emm,x);
    *y = pow(-1,emm)*Plm*sin(emm*fi);}
  else{
    Plm = gsl_sf_legendre_sphPlm(ell,emm,x);
    *y = (REAL)pow(-1,emm)*Plm*sin(emm*fi);}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

The code above is the wrapper. Note that it includes a header
file called ${\tt headers_c.h}$ which actually defines what
${\tt FTNIZE}$ means. The header file, also from pencil-code
is given below:
<div class="code">
  <pre><code class="language-c">
/*                             headers_c.h
                              ------------

/* Pick correct number of underscores here (2 for g95 without

#if (FUNDERSC == 0)
#  define FTNIZE(name) name
#elif (FUNDERSC == 1)
#  define FTNIZE(name) name##_
#else
#  define FTNIZE(name) name##__
#endif

/* End of file */
</code></pre>
</div>

To the best of my knowledge this part of coding in the pencil-code
was done by Wolfgang Dobler. Which underscore is chosen
is chosen by an option in the ${\tt Makefile}$ . The
example of the ${\tt Makefile}$ is not given here, you
should try to write it. 

<h4> Finding roots of transcendental equations </h4>

<p> This is a topic of immense pleasure because this is where numerical shall beat
analytical treatment hands down. </p>

<p> The principal method is the binary chop or variant thereof -- Example from Acton pages 41 to 45
-- Newton's method -- false position method -- secant method </p>

<h4> Concept of Fortran module </p>

Organizing code using module -- how to keep a tool box -- organize our codes in modules and
calling them.

<h4> Complex roots of polynomials </h4>

Acton page 189 - 193. -- Newton's method

<h4> Iterating complex maps </h4>

Mandelbrot set and fractals. Code to construct the Cantor set, the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set.

<h4> Homework Problems </h4> 
<p> <font size=2 em>Please return the solution of these problems by Friday 22nd of February midnight. The computer 
programs should be checked-in in your directory at Google Drive that we share. The handwritten answers
should be in my mailbox by the morning of 23rd February or handed over to me in class on the same
day. The marks allocated to each problem is give inside parenthesis. The total marks of this homework 
adds up to $100$. </font> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Take the program we wrote in class to calculate the greatest
  common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Use this as a subroutine to calculate the
  lowest common multiple (LCM), which is the smallest integer that can be divided (with zero remainder)
  by both the given integers, e.g., the LCM of $3$ and $2$ is $6$.
  <li> Numerical solution of the transcendental equation:
      Use the ${\tt gsl}$ library and the routine to find roots by the secant method that you have written in the homework problem
      of Lecture 1 to solve the following problem: 
      For $\ell = 10$, $r_{\rm min} =0.7$ and $r_{\rm max}=1.$, find $\alpha$ such that the following equations are solved,
      \begin{equation}
        a_{\ell}j_{\ell}(\alpha r) + b_{\ell}n_{\ell}(\alpha r) = 0
      \end{equation}
      for $r=r_{\rm min},r_{\rm max}$. Here the $j_{\ell}$ and $n_{\ell}$ are spherical Bessel functions.
      There are infinite number of solutions for $\alpha$, find the first three in increasing order.
     This equation arises while trying to solve the force-free equations in spherical coordinates. You can get further details about
      the solution of the force--free equations from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...126..457C">Chandrasekhar and Kendall, Astrophysical Journal, <b> 126</b>, 457 (1975)</a>.
  The solution of the transcendental equation is used in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:0812.3106"> Mitra, Tavakol, Brandenburg and Moss, Astrophysical Journal, <b>697</b>923 (2008).</a>
