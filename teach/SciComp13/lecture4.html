<h4> Homework Problems </h4> 
<p> <font size=2 em>Please return the solution of these problems by Thursday 15th of March midnight. The computer 
programs should be checked-in in your directory at Google Drive that we share. The handwritten answers
should be in my mailbox by the morning of 16th of March or handed over to me in class on the same
day. The marks allocated to each problem is give inside parenthesis. The total marks of this homework 
adds up to $100$. </font> </p>

 <p> For all the problems below, you can use the integrator module we wrote in class. </p>
<ol>
 <li> Start integrating the simple harmonic oscillator:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \dot{x}  &=& p \\  
 \dot{p}  &=&  -\omega_0^2 x  \\  
\end{eqnarray}
with your choice of $\omega_0$ to plot its trajectory in the $x-p$ plane. This is the
trajectory of the oscillator in phase space. By choosing many different intial conditions
construct the phase space of the harmonic oscillator.  
<li> Numerically solve the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi} \left( \xi^2\frac{df}{d\xi} \right) = - f^3
\end{equation}
with the boundary conditions, $f^{\prime}(0) = 0 $ and $f(1) = 0$. 
In particular show that $f(0) = 6.897$ and $f^{\prime}(1) = -2.018$. 

This equations arises in study of equilibrium of a star. If we consider the star
to be made of relavistic electrons, its chemical potential is related to its
density by 
\begin{equation}
\mu = (3\pi^2)^{1/3} \hbar c \left ( \frac{\rho}{m^{\prime}} \right)^{1/3} 
\end{equation}  
where $\mu$ is the chemical potential as a function of radius $r$ and $\rho$ is the
density. Take $m^{\prime} = 2 m_n$ where $m_n$ is nucleon mass. The density is related to
the chemical potential also by the differential equation, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2\frac{d \mu}{dr} \right) = - 4\pi m^{\prime} G \rho 
\end{equation}
From these two relations we obtain, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2\frac{d \mu}{dr} \right) = - \lambda \mu^3, \hspace{2cm}

\lambda =  \frac{4 G (m^{\prime})^2}{3\pi c^3 \hbar^3}  \rho 
\end{equation}
From dimensional consideration one can argue that 
\begin{equation}
\mu(r) = \frac{1}{R\sqrt{\lambda}} f\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius of the star. Substituting $\xi = r/R$ we obtain the differential
equation we solve. From the numerical solution for $\mu$ plot the the density as a function
of $r/R$. You should be able to reproduce the "Curve 2" in Fig 50 of the book 
"Statistical Physics" by Landau and Lifshitz.  You may have already realised that you
can use your numerical solution to show that the "critical mass" of a white dwarf
$M_0 $ is approximately equal to $1.45$ times the solar mass -- 
the famous Chandrasekhar limit.  
<li> <font color="dark-violet">Henon-Heiles problem: </font>
<p> Consider the motion of a particle of unit mass in two dimensions under the action of the 
hamiltonian
\begin{eqnarray}
{\mathcal H} &=& {\mathcal U}(x,y) + \frac{1}{2}(p^2_x + p^2_y) \\
{\mathcal U} &=& \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \epsilon\left[x^2y - \frac{1}{3} y^3  \right]
\end{eqnarray} 
where $p_x = \dot{x} $ and $p_y= \dot{y}$. If $\epsilon=0$ we have the
standard problem of a particle in a harmonic potential in two dimensions.
For this exercise set $\epsilon=0$.  First write down the differential equations describing the
motion of particle of unit mass in the Hamiltonian ${\mathcal H}$. Then solve these equations
using the ode-solver written in class. You can do this by adding a new file called ${\tt henon\_heiles.f90}$
motivated by the way the file ${\tt harmonic.f90}$ is written. As this is an hamiltonian system energy ($E$) is a
conserved quantity that you can use to monitor the accuracy of your numerical integration scheme.
The motion is now described in four-dimensional phase space of $x,y,p_x,p_y$.  For a fixed value of the
conserved energy $E$ the motion can be described in the three dimensional space of $x,y,p_y$.
Consider three different values of the energy $E = 0.08333,0.1250$,and $0.16667$. For each of these
values : </p>
<ol>
  <li> plot the time-series of $x$,$y$,$p_x$ and $p_y$ for sufficient duration to give a qualitative
      idea of their evolution.
  <li> In the three dimensional space of $x,y,p_y$ consider the successive intersection of the trajectory
       with the plane $x=0$. These points of intersections generate as set of points on the $(y,p_y)$ plane.
       In this plane a point of intersection $P_{i+1}$ can be considered to be a map of the point $P_i$.
       This technique of reducing the dimension of the problem by one by looking at the intersection of the
       trajectory with a fixed plane in space is called taking a Poincare section. Plot the Poincare section
       for the three values of $E$. 
</ol>
This problem first arose in studies galactic motion. Please see the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964AJ.....69...73H">original paper</a>
for a detailed description of this problem. The importance of this problem in studies of nonlinear dynamics can hardly be overstressed. 
A beautiful personal description of the problem by M. Henon is 
<a href="http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1988/A1988L586000001.pdf">here</a>.
<li> <font color="dark-violet">Lorenz problem: </font>
<p> The following set of three ordinary differential equations was proposed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a> as a simplified model of convection.
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x} &=& \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} &=&  x(\rho - z) - y   \\
\dot{z} &=&  xy - \beta z 
\end{eqnarray}
Solve this set using the ode-solver we have written in class. Unlike the Henon-Heiles systems, energy is not a conserved quantity in this
problem. This is rather an example of a dissipative dynamical system. Use $\rho = 28$, $\sigma = 10$ and $\beta = 8/3$.
Calculate the trajectory for four different initial conditions. You can plot the trajectories using three dimensional plot, e.g., by using
the ${\tt plot3d}$ function in matplotlib. This way, generate the famous two lobed Lorenz-attractor. Make several three dimensional
plot of this attractor from different viewing angles. An example of this attractor can be found at
