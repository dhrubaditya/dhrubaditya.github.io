<h3> Introduction to Fluid Mechanics</h3>

<p>  This course is being taught jointly by myself and Jonas Nycander. The advertisement is 
  <a href='https://www.fysik.su.se/english/education/new-course-in-fluid-mechanics-1.389396'>here </a>.
  This is 7.5 credits course but running at half the speed of usual courses. There is one two-hour
lecture on every Wednesday evening. Alternate lectures has one hour tutorial appended to it. 
</p> 
<h4> Course Materials </h4>
At this moment we are not totally satisfied with any book, however it is useful to have one
textbook for the convenience of the students. We are going to use the following book:
"Fluid Mechanics - A short course for physicists", Gregory Falkovich, Cambridge University Press (CUP).
Stockholm University library subscribes to book of CUP, hence you can read this book online (and legally)
through the library webpage. We also recommend some additional material: 
<ul>
<li> You should read these two wonderful lectures
  by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">R.P. Feynman</a>: <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_40.html">Flow of dry water</a> and
   <a href= "http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_41.html ">Flow of wet water </a>.
These two chapters are part of the course materials, they shall be 
referred as FL chapter 40 and FL chapter 41 respectively. The Feynman lectures are freely available online.  
</ul>
<p>
<b>Tentative plans </b>:
<ul>
</li> The first two lectures will be given by Jonas. The idea is to recapitulate vector algebra. 
</li> I start teaching from the third lecture. I strongly recommend that you read the two lectures by Feynman yourself
before you start the course.  
<li> The textbook has material on both compressible and incompressible flows. We shall not deal with compressible flows.
<li> We have noticed that the textbook has several printing mistakes, also the author is somewhat cavalier with 
symbols, in the sense that not all vectors are in bold face althought most of them are, or sometime the dot between two vectors is understood and not explicitly written. You do not have the same freedom as the author of a book, 
be very careful with your symbols and train your fingers well. 
<li> In every alternate class we are likely to hand you a problem set. Please return it in the next class when during
the tutorial it will be solved for you. A fraction of the end credits will depend on how well you solve these problem. 
</ul>
